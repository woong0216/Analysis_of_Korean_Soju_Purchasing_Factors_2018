# Data Analysis-Soju Korea Beer
## Propose
- What factors do Korean university students buy soju when they buy it?
- We would like to analyze objective factors through a survey.
## Survey
- A survey was conducted on university students to find out the cause of purchasing soju by university students. <br/>

- Data Collected
> Variable(변수): Level(도수), Hangover(숙취), Neck Sweep(목넘김), Event(이벤트), Advertising Model(광고모델), Scarcity(희소성), Design(디자인) <br/>

## Conclusion
- factor analysis (none)
> The correlation between Level and Advertising Model was the highest. <br/>
> There was a high correlation between Neck Sweep and Design. <br/>
- factor analysis (regression)
> We confirmed that the Advertising Model is important in choosing Soju. <br/>
> The Level also has a high relationship to choose. <br/>
> There was a high correlation between Neck Sweep and Design. <br/>
- Synthesis
> Advertising models are identified as important marketing. <br/>
> Design is also important in purchasing. <br/>
> Since there are fewer datasets, it is thought that it can be more accurate if the data is collected in large quantities. <br/>
